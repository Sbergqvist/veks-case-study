# Power BI Implementation Guide - VEKS Energy Analytics

## Overview

This guide covers the implementation of Power BI dashboards using the VEKS energy market data. The focus is on creating actionable insights for district heating operations and CHP optimization.

## Dataset Information

### Primary Data Files

**Main Dataset**: `veks_electricity_market_data_*.csv`
- Contains 1,440 records covering DK1 and DK2 price areas
- 30 days of electricity market data
- Key columns: SpotPriceDKK, PriceArea, CHPOptimal, HeatingDemand

**Daily Summary**: `veks_daily_analytics_*.csv`  
- Aggregated daily statistics
- Volatility and price range analysis
- Risk assessment categories

**CHP Analysis**: `veks_chp_optimization_*.csv`
- Hour-by-hour optimization recommendations
- Peak price identification
- Production planning insights

**Regional Spread**: `veks_dk1_dk2_spread_*.csv` (when available)
- Price differences between DK1 and DK2
- Market arbitrage opportunities

## Dashboard Structure

### Executive Overview
Key metrics for leadership decision-making:
- Average electricity prices across regions
- Market volatility indicators  
- CHP optimization opportunities
- Revenue impact analysis

### Operational Dashboard
Focus on day-to-day operations:
- Peak price hour identification
- Heating demand correlation
- Regional price comparisons
- Weekly operational patterns

## DAX Measures

```dax
CHP Optimal Hours Count = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(veks_electricity_market_data),
    veks_electricity_market_data[CHPOptimal] = "Peak - CHP Optimal"
)

Average Peak Price = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(veks_electricity_market_data[SpotPriceDKK]),
    veks_electricity_market_data[CHPOptimal] = "Peak - CHP Optimal"
)

Price Volatility = 
STDEV.P(veks_electricity_market_data[SpotPriceDKK])

Revenue Opportunity = 
[Average Peak Price] - [Average Off Peak Price]
```

## Key Visualizations

### 1. Regional Price Trends
- Line chart showing DK1 vs DK2 daily averages
- Helps identify regional market dynamics
- Critical for VEKS' multi-region operations

### 2. CHP Optimization Matrix
- Heatmap showing optimal production hours
- Cross-reference with heating demand periods
- Revenue maximization insights

### 3. Market Intelligence Cards
- KPI cards for key metrics
- Real-time market positioning
- Performance tracking

## Business Value Propositions

### For VEKS Operations
