# Power BI Dashboard Guide - Energinet Data Pipeline

This guide explains how to import and create professional dashboards in Power BI using the generated data files.

## Data Files Overview

The enhanced pipeline has created multiple **Power BI-ready CSV files**:

### 1. Main Dataset: `electricity_data_powerbi_*.csv`
- **4,320 records** of electricity price data
- **30 days** of comprehensive data (May 28 - June 26, 2025)
- **6 market areas**: DE, DK1, DK2, NO2, SE3, SE4

**Key Columns:**
- `HourDK`: Danish timestamp (use as main time axis)
- `SpotPriceDKK`: Price in Danish Krone (main metric)
- `PriceArea`: Market area (geographic dimension)
- `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`: Time dimensions
- `DayOfWeek`: Day name (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- `IsWeekend`: Boolean for weekend analysis
- `PriceCategory`: Low/Medium/High/Very High classification

### 2. Daily Statistics: `daily_statistics_powerbi_*.csv`
- **182 records** of daily aggregated data
- Pre-calculated statistics for each day and market area

**Key Columns:**
- `AvgPriceDKK`, `MinPriceDKK`, `MaxPriceDKK`: Daily price statistics
- `StdPriceDKK`: Price volatility measure

### 3. Market Area Summary: `market_areas_summary_*.csv`
- **6 records** summarizing each market area
- Perfect for comparison visualizations

### 4. Hourly Patterns: `hourly_patterns_powerbi_*.csv`
- **144 records** (24 hours × 6 areas)
- Average prices by hour of day for pattern analysis

## Power BI Import Steps

### Step 1: Import Data
1. Open Power BI Desktop
2. Click **Get Data** → **Text/CSV**
3. Import the main file: `electricity_data_powerbi_*.csv`
4. Import additional files as separate tables
5. Ensure date columns are properly recognized as Date/Time

### Step 2: Data Model Setup
1. **Create relationships** between tables:
   - Link `electricity_data_powerbi` with `daily_statistics_powerbi` on Date + PriceArea
   - Link with `hourly_patterns_powerbi` on Hour + PriceArea

2. **Create a Date table** (recommended):
   ```DAX
   DateTable = CALENDAR(MIN(electricity_data_powerbi[HourDK]), MAX(electricity_data_powerbi[HourDK]))
   ```

### Step 3: Key Measures (DAX)
Create these calculated measures for professional dashboards:

```dax
// Average Price
Avg Price = AVERAGE(electricity_data_powerbi[SpotPriceDKK])

// Price Volatility
Price Volatility = STDEV.S(electricity_data_powerbi[SpotPriceDKK])

// Weekend vs Weekday Comparison
Weekend Premium = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE([Avg Price], electricity_data_powerbi[IsWeekend] = TRUE),
    CALCULATE([Avg Price], electricity_data_powerbi[IsWeekend] = FALSE)
) - 1

// Peak Hour Indicator
Is Peak Hour = IF(electricity_data_powerbi[Hour] >= 17 && electricity_data_powerbi[Hour] <= 20, "Peak", "Off-Peak")

// Price Change from Previous Day
Price Change = 
VAR PreviousPrice = CALCULATE([Avg Price], DATEADD(DateTable[Date], -1, DAY))
RETURN [Avg Price] - PreviousPrice
```

## Recommended Dashboard Layout

### Page 1: Executive Summary
- **KPI Cards**: Average Price, Total Records, Date Range, Price Volatility
- **Line Chart**: Daily average prices by market area (trending)
- **Map Visual**: Market areas with average prices
- **Gauge**: Current price vs. historical average

### Page 2: Market Analysis
- **Bar Chart**: Average price by market area
- **Heat Map**: Price volatility by area and time
- **Scatter Plot**: Price correlation between areas
- **Table**: Market area statistics summary

### Page 3: Time Pattern Analysis
- **Line Chart**: Hourly price patterns (24-hour cycle)
- **Heat Map**: Hour of day vs. day of week pricing
- **Bar Chart**: Weekend vs. weekday comparison
- **Calendar Visual**: Daily price levels

### Page 4: Price Distribution
- **Histogram**: Price distribution by category
- **Box Plot**: Price ranges by market area
- **Waterfall Chart**: Price components analysis
- **Funnel Chart**: Price category breakdown

## Interview Talking Points

### Technical Excellence
- **Data Pipeline**: "I built an automated pipeline that fetches real-time electricity market data from Energinet's API"
- **Data Quality**: "The pipeline includes data validation, error handling, and comprehensive logging"
- **Scalability**: "Designed for easy extension to additional datasets and market areas"

### Business Value
- **Market Insights**: "The dashboard reveals price patterns across Nordic electricity markets"
- **Operational Intelligence**: "Hour-by-hour analysis helps identify peak pricing periods"
- **Risk Management**: "Volatility metrics support trading and hedging decisions"

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **API Integration**: RESTful API consumption with proper error handling
- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipeline with Pandas transformations
- **Analytics**: Statistical analysis and pattern recognition
- **Visualization**: Both Plotly (web) and Power BI (business) dashboards
- **Data Formats**: Parquet (efficient storage) and CSV (Power BI compatibility)

## Sample Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: "How would you handle missing data in this pipeline?"**
A: "I've implemented several strategies: API timeout handling, data validation with pandas, and logging for monitoring. For missing values, I use forward-fill for time series continuity and flag anomalies for review."

**Q: "How would you scale this for real-time monitoring?"**
A: "I'd implement incremental loading, add a scheduler (like Apache Airflow), use a streaming platform (Kafka), and include data quality alerts with automatic failover mechanisms."

**Q: "What insights can you derive from this electricity data?"**
A: "The data reveals price volatility patterns, cross-market arbitrage opportunities, peak demand periods, renewable energy impact on pricing, and weekend vs. weekday consumption patterns."

## Data Insights for Interview Discussion

Based on the processed data:
- **4,320 records** across **6 market areas**
- **Average price**: 373.27 DKK/MWh
